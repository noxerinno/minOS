Minimalist operating system

## Inspiration

The idea for this project comes from [V2F's youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELTwwTsR5w8).
Through it, I aim to challenge myself in the same conditions as the content creator did. I'll have a week to try and create a basic operating system from scratch.
